# ==============================================
# Phase 1 Assessment – Python Basics
# Fill in your answers under each question.
# ==============================================

# Q1. Variables, Data Types & Operators
# Create two variables: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
# Print sum, difference, product, division, and modulus in a sentence
# Example output:
# 12 + 5 = 17
# 12 - 5 = 7
# 12 * 5 = 60
# 12 / 5 = 2.4
# 12 % 5 = 2

num1 = 12
num2 = 5

print (f"The sum is {num1 + num2}")
print (f"The diff is {num1 - num2}")
print (f"The product is {num1 * num2}")
print (f"The division is {num1 / num2}")
print (f"The modulus is {num1 % num2}")

# Q2. Strings
# Create a string: text = "PythonProgramming"
# Print the first 6 characters, last 6 characters, and uppercase version
# Use f-strings to print the output
# Example output:
# First 6: Python, Last 6: mming, Uppercase: PYTHONPROGRAMMING

text = "PythonProgramming"
print (f"First 6: {text[:6]}, Last 6: {text[-6:]}, Uppercase: {text.upper()}")

# Q3. Lists & Tuples
# Create a list of 5 numbers
# Print the largest number
# Convert the list to a tuple and print it

numbers = [10, 5, 8, 20, 15]
print (f"The largest number is {max(numbers)}")

# Your code here



# Q4. Dictionaries & Sets
# Create a dictionary: student = {"name":"Edd","age":10,"grade":4}
# Print: "Edd is 10 years old and in Grade 4."
# Create a set of 5 colors, add "yellow", remove "red", print final set

student = {"name":"Edd","age":10,"grade":4}
colors = {"red", "blue", "green", "orange", "purple"}

print (f"{student['name']} is {student['age']} years old and in Grade {student['grade']}.")
colors.add("yellow")
print (colors)

# Q5. If/Else Conditions & Loops
# Ask the user for a number
# Print "Even" if the number is even, else print "Odd"
# Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to that number

# Your code here
num =input("Enter a number: ")
if int(num) % 2 == 0:
    print ("Even")
else:
    print ("Odd")




# Q6. Functions & Scope
# Write a function square(n) that returns the square of n
# Ask the user for a number, call the function, and print the result
# Demonstrate local vs global variable example

# Your code here

def square(n):
    return n * n
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print (f"The square of {num} is {square(num)}")


# Q7. Mini Project – Grade Checker
# 1. Ask user for marks (0–100)
# 2. Print "Fail" if <50, "Pass" if 50–79, "Distinction" if 80+
# 3. Store student info in a dictionary with keys: name, marks
# 4. Print summary sentence
# Example: Edd scored 85 and achieved Distinction.
