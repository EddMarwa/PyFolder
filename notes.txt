Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

**Advantages of OOP**
Provides a clear structure to programs
Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Allows you to build reusable applications with less code
Tip: The DRY principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once. Move repeated code into functions or classes and reuse it.

You put in pass to avoid getting an error in python
